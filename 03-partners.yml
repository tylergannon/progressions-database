    *When the 7 Killings appears in the Partners Palace with any of the stars that eclipse it you will be occasionally visited by irrational concerns. Doubts will occasionally haunt you (jealousy, self-worth issues). (Check with each major star and consider what they offer in terms of eclipse).*

    If you are self-reflective (don’t blame others), kind, generous and helpful to others and then marry late (after 40), the afflictions will be avoided.

    * You will blame partners for a series of divorces that are your Fate.

    You have fate to divorce, be a widow(er) or create a very unconventional relationship. You will quickly find fault and misjudge potential partners. You will be married to an ex-con, junkie by a Druid, while African drums drown out the sound of the waves at Muir beach.

    * When Rebel appears in the Partners Palace you and/or your chosen partner will be possessed/haunted by a Rebel ghost (who died unloved). You will marry early (or late) and then divorce. You will marry against the advice of others (elders, parents) and it ends in divorce.
    * You will not marry but live with a lover.
    * You are promiscuous.
    * You will marry your “roommate” at San Francisco town hall (gay just to be “different”).
    * If there are other afflicting stars, your divorce may be painfully damaging to you and/or your partner (premature death, madness).

    If you fail to resolve Rebel before you die you (or both) will “be influenced” by the ghost in the transitory states.
