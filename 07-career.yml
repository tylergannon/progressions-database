    * You will make sacrifices and struggle to succeed but receive only limited rewards for your hard work.
    * You are best suited to a career in the travel/resort industry, emergency room medicine and/or prison system.
    * You will take a job that is makes you weird: undertaker, embalmer, hit-man, spy or criminal on the run.
    * If there are no other afflicting stars, you are likely to change jobs many times developing no skills.
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you will live an unsettled life, emigrate, wander (and die) far from where you were born.

    All the above is due to the promptings and obstructions of the unsettled dead.

    * You will work in an unusual field, do unusual research and/or move to a foreign country.
      * Pojun (who died far from home [lost]) will give you an irrational need to wander, abandon opportunities and/or quit jobs.
    * You are best suited to work in an “alternative setting”: political activism, alternative medicine, consulting, translating.
    * If there are no other afflicting stars, you are likely to simply change jobs several times or travel a great deal.
    * To resolve Pojun in this house you must “settle down” (after much drifting).

    If there are other afflicting stars, you will live an unsettled life, wandering far from home and working without developing skills. You will feel that any success is a “sell out”. If you fail to resolve Pojun (establish home/career) before you die, you will “be influenced by” the ghost in the transitory states.
