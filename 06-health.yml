    * You enjoy routine exercise and healthy food.
    * Your immunity is weak but your ability to recover is strong.
    * If there are no afflicting stars, you will have a long life.

    All the above is due to the promptings and obstructions of the unsettled dead.

    * Your illnesses have ancestral demonic cause.

    * Dying on a battlefield reiterates the pattern of Fate.
    * You will be prone to addictions and risk taking.
    * You are likely to suffer neurosis, irrational fears, anxiety attacks and depression.

    Your Fate related to health is uneven and recoveries come only through “alternative treatment”.

    * When Rebel appears in the Health Palace you have a weak constitution and will be haunted by hypochondria, low-grade infections and chronic illness.
    * You will be possessed by Pojun (who died in pain or from qi exhaustion) and be obsessed with doctors and/or addicted to medications (legal or illegal).
    * You will be unable to recover from even minor illnesses.
    * You will have allergies and skin problems when young.
    * You will have back pain, a limp, a handicap and/or carry a prominent scar.
    * You have a constitutional weakness in your lower digestive system (diarrhea/constipation).
    * Your health will decline as you mature unless you resolve Pojun by strengthen yourself with healthy habits (often begun after “recovery” or scarring).
    * You are an undisciplined patient and will die of complications derived from treatment.
    * If there are other afflicting stars that exacerbate the problem you are likely to have a short life and “join” the ghost to become a haunting ghost in the transitory states.

    When the Rebel appears in the Health Palace with any subordinate star:

    * You will be a weak child.
    * You will find a very personal path to recover your health by midlife.
    * External causes quickly enter your body. Sudden reversals of health occur.
    * You suffer from skin problems, congestive disorders (Liver and Lungs).
    * You overeat and then purge. This type of pattern characterizes your medical history.
