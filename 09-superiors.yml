    *When the 7 Killings rules the Superiors Palace*:

    it is unaffected by any/all other stars. The auspice of this placement is both good and bad.

    You will no doubt struggle in your life with the notion of relationships – particularly issues of authority. Many of the people you work with will be possessed of 7 kiliings – have irrational fears and notions of you that undermine your work.

    Conversely, you will have an opportunity to see through this dilemma and, with patience and wisdom, resolve this Fate (demon).

    You are in a powerful position to overcome selfishness, belligerence and neurotic fears – look at character and elsewhere in the other 11 houses for support.

    * You have predestined affinity to resolve Pojun (who died in battle) by excelling in the military, contra-military (terrorist) activity or monastic life. Pojun is easily resolved in this house by living in an environment where authority and discipline are clear and strong.
    * If you work/study in an “alternative setting” you will develop strong self- discipline and receive good training from competent teachers.
    * You will meet and commit to a radically powerful shaman, guru, mentor or spiritual teacher of some sort. He/she will resolve the ghost on your behalf.
    * If no other afflicting stars appear here you are likely to excel at work that is rejected, distasteful or repugnant to others.
    * Your spirit will be honored for your life’s work (group monument) long after you die.
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you may be passed over by all honors and promotions. In the unlikely event that you fail to resolve Pojun (establish safety/honor/rank) before you die you will “be distracted by” the ghost in the transitory states. New opportunity for resolution (your spiritual practice: karma) will appear in the bardo.
