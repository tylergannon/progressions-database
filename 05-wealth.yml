    Your Fate here is uneven and success comes only through speculation or “alternative sources”.

    * When Rebel appears in the Wealth Palace you are likely to be financially ambitious (possessed by the pojun ghost who died poor [robbed/murdered]) and profit from high-risk speculation, investing in the stock market, gambling or illegal means.
    * Your finances will fluctuate radically throughout your life.
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you will go bankrupt, suffer humiliating losses and/or leave no legacy.
    * If there are no other afflicting stars, you will eventually achieve financial security.
    * Establishing financial security (leaving a legacy) is the resolution of the pojun ghost in this house.

    *With any auspicious star*:

    * You will find wealth through a variety of means.
    * You will work in a strange or unconventional field and do quite well.
    * You will work 7 days a week at 3 different jobs.
    * You will profit from invention or speculative investments.
    * You live in a National Park and hunt deer – you are an eccentric hermit.

    * Your pursuit of wealth brings physical and mental exhaustion.
    * You seriously resent the rich. It is your downfall.
