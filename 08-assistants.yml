    * You are gullible and a bad judge of character. You often choose harmful helpers.
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you will be betrayed, robbed and ruined repeatedly by unreliable and sneaky subordinates (possessed of an ancestral demon). All the above is due to the promptings and obstructions of the unsettled dead.

    When the 7 Killings rules the Assistants Palace it is unaffected by any/all other stars. The auspice of this placement is both good and bad. You will no doubt struggle in your life with the notion of relationships – particularly issues of authority. Many of the people you work with will be possessed of 7 kiliings – have irrational fears and notions of you that undermine your work. Conversely, you will have an opportunity to see through this dilemma and, with patience and wisdom, resolve this Fate (demon).

    You are in a powerful position to overcome selfishness, belligerence and neurotic fears – look at character and elsewhere in the other 11 houses for support. Where is the General and Oracle?

    * When Rebel appears in the Assistants Palace Pojun (who was tormented and/or murdered by someone close to them) gives you a paranoid character that invites subordinate helpers to abandon and betray you.
    * Your fate with helpers is very uneven – sometimes great, sometimes disastrous – a rollercoaster.
    * Possessed by Pojun you may choose to work alone.
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you will be betrayed and undermined by vicious, conniving subordinates.
    * To resolve Pojun in this house you must practice great patience and kindness towards others.
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you will feel victimized, abused and/or haunted by unworthy “others”. If you fail to resolve Pojun (establish helpers/family/community) before you die you will “join” the ghost as a lost spirit in the transitory states

    * You are crippled by idealism and fantasies that never come to fruition.
    * You will abandon and be abandoned by other fanatics and idealists.
    * Your enormous sacrifices will amount to nothing. Your dreams are unfulfilled.
    * You seek martyrdom. A lame interpretation of jihad appeals to you.
