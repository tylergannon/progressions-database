    * You are a rebellious child. You hurt your parents.
    * Your ancestral qi is a demonic curse. You inherit irresolvable issues from you ancestors. 
    * Your life is an expression of the anxiety and pain of the unresolved dead. 
    * You are a victim of child abuse. 
    * You want to repeat the abuse you received. 
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you will be haunted by irreconcilable anxiety – mental illness. 
    * You may die on a battlefield. 
    * You ancestors have assigned you a difficult exorcism as part of your Fate.

    When the 7 Killings rules the Ancestor Palace it is unaffected by any/all other stars. The auspice of this placement is related to the untimely death of an ancestor who has developed into a demonic force.

    * You have a genetic predisposition to die young.
    * You will participate in dangerous and even life-threatening misadventures as if possessed.
    * You will take your life/survival lightly.
    * You are prone to accident and injury.
    * You are likely to die suddenly and be consumed by fear/horror in the moment of death.

    * You are possessed of a ghost (who feels severely [many generations] isolated [orphaned]) and who rejects its heritage, ethnicity, family, ancestors, or (one or both) parents. You will rebel against your parents and have a rift with one (or both) parent.
    * Your ancestral qi is afflicted – though you inherit unresolved issues from you ancestors, you practice denial/self-centeredness. 
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you will be haunted by nervousness, paranoia and even madness. You may die on a battlefield fighting the enemies of your ancestors. 
    * You may be infertile or impotent. If you fail to resolve Pojun (honor your ancestors, enlist tian ji, care for your family) before you die you will “be absorbed by” the ghost in the transitory states (birth as a demon).
