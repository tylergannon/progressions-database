    There will be a strong resolution of Fate in childhood possibly related to family members (siblings in particular).

    * When the Emperor appears without affliction1 in the Youth Palace or House of Siblings you have a strong predestined affinity with one (male) or all of your siblings all your life. It is likely an indicator of both personal and material support from him (them).
    * It also indicates the early and strong sense of identity. You will be precociousness at school.
    * It indicates that childhood is a rich karmic time of your life. You will meet “karmic” friends and/or enemies in your youth. Much Fate will be resolved in childhood.
    * Your youth will be spent seriously training for adulthood.

    There will be a strong resolution of Fate in childhood related to matriarchal ancestor(s), dreams, imagination or intuition. The yin nature of the Oracle is easily afflicted but afflictions are also usually overcome.

    * When the Oracle appears without affliction in the Youth/Siblings Palace your predestined affinity with your brothers and sisters is fragile. When the feelings are handled carefully there will be a deep and supportive exchange.
    * Your predestined affinity with your siblings is characterized by empathy.
    * You will be a very imaginative and sensitive child that will learn to deal with your sensitivity successfully as you mature. You are bound to become a modest, kind and generous person.
    * You have a psychic link with your sibling(s) and/or your matriarchal ancestors.
    * Your youth is fairly unstable, due to hypersensitivity.
    * Your imaginary friends are real.

    * Without effort Fate is resolved in childhood.
    * Your imagination, the playing of games and/or the home, forests and/or city alleyways of your childhood neighborhood (Roofbeam) will contain disembodied benefactors that guide you through your Fate.
    * At times your siblings will play an active role in this resolution as if possessed of matriarchal ancestors.
    * Your siblings will provide Fate resolution through their loving and material support throughout your life.
    * You are intuitively “joined at the hip” with one or more siblings.
    * Returning to your childhood home (ancestral home - Roofbeam) facilitates Fate resolution throughout your life.
    * You and your siblings are a coven or kula of spiritual practitioners.

    * Obstacles exist in your sibling relationships. These obstacles are sometimes unfounded emotions such as anger (Fire/Water), fear (Goat Blade/Humpback) and distrust (Loss/Void).
    * Though these problems exist they do not or cannot truly sever the ties between you and your siblings.
    * In these circumstances giving and accepting apologies is very helpful.
    * These same indicators will also apply to a person whose sensitivity is unwelcome in childhood - this pushes them into a deep sense of shyness and confusion.
    * Several or many of these minor afflicting stars can “gang up” to limit our ability to receive and/or express the Oracle’s deep inspiration.

    There will be a strong predestined affinity with your siblings. You will be mutually supportive and close. Much of the Fate to be resolved in your life will be found and unraveled in your relationships with siblings (brothers). Your siblings and home setting (Roofbeam) will be pivotal in the resolution of Fate. You may have strong childhood identity based on family (Moon), place, nationality/ethnicity (Roofbeam) or class/status (Storehouse). You will be a confident youth. You will be ambitious, competitive and/or show leadership when young.

    Indicates a elderly parent, protector, mentor in your childhood that is pivotal in resolving your Fate. If this is not the case, then very little of your Fate can be resolved until you grow old (56+). Since the General is often weak in this palace (unless luminous); its influence is easily afflicted or postponed.

    * You have little or no predestined affinity with brothers or sisters.
    * You will have few or no brothers and sisters.
    * You will be a troubled youth or juvenile delinquent. As a child you will not “fit in”.
    * You are a precocious caregiver and will play parent for your siblings, friends or parents.

    * Though you have few or no siblings there is an important parent, ancestral guardian, teacher or mentor in your childhood that helps resolve your Fate.
    * Much of the resolution of your Fate is out of your hands – handled by extraordinary ancestors (Empress [matriarchal], Tutor) [patriarchal]).
    * Any Fate resolution that happens in childhood will be related to relationships at school (Tutor, Magistrate or Priest).
    * You are a clueless “poor little rich kid”. The resolution of your Fate is postponed but ultimately resolved like an inheritance (Storehouse) received later in life.
    * You are Sal Mineo in Rebel Without a Cause.

    Indicates you will harvest some dark Fate in childhood. You will attract an inappropriate alliance with a person who harms or abuses you as an escape from isolation. In an effort to establish independence you will subordinate to a dark or anti-social person (lover). You will follow an ill- behaved sibling. This bad judgment will turn into a series of choices (addictions) that strengthens the entanglement and weight of your Fate. You will live as a “survivor” of your youth. You will fail at recovery schemes. You will fall in with the “wrong crowd” and enjoy degradation (sado-masochism).

    Your shared sibling Fate is irresolvable. There is a demonic qi manifest in your sibling relationships. You will be harmed/injured by or lose (by sudden death/suicide) a sibling. Your sibling shared Fate is full of betrayal, conflicting emotions and abandonment. Resolution of any kind will be based on loss and/or escape.

    * You will have few or no siblings.
    * You are a reclusive or anti-social child, finding people disappointing in general.
    * Your sexuality may bloom early and cause you to mature too quickly. This will make you feel disconnected and distrustful of your peers (generation).
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you will not get support from your siblings.
    * You will be injured when young.
    * All the above are due to the negative promptings and obstructions of the unsettled dead.

    * You will grow up very fast and use school and work as a Path (Magistrate).
    * Intelligence must be used to overcome the urge to overreact.
    * Tremendous difficulties in childhood will open your spiritual Path (Priest).

    * You will be tormented as a child by siblings and an irresolvable tangle of Fate (demonic).
    * The lingering ghosts of your family possess all your siblings from time to time. The only release available from the darkness of this Fate is complete and utter abandonment (apophetic release).
    * Consider monasticism.
    * If this affliction goes unresolved you may take your own life or be devoured in the intermediate states (bardo) by overwhelming negativity.
    * Such a harsh experience is a resolution.

    Your shared sibling Fate is weak. You are an only child. You are unable to relate to siblings. You are adopted – have only step-siblings. You spend much of your youth struggling to be an adult.

    * When Rebel appears in the Youth/Siblings Palace your sibling shared Fate will be full of drama and contain several reversals of feeling.
    * You have no predestined affinity with supportive siblings.
    * Your youth will be spent “bucking authority”. You may leave school before graduation, run away from home or get adopted.
