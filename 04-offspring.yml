    When the *Emperor* appears in the *Children Palace* or Fourth House without affliction there will be
    a smooth continuity in your family line. You will have bright and supportive children (son) who will 
    follow and serve you until your death. Having children is a strong attribute of your Fate. 
    Alternately your sexuality or sexual identity is strong and important.

    In houses associated with relationships it is important to remember that the info is about the Parent here – 
    about how you relate to your kids and parenting. Auspice is really shaped by character.
    
    * When the Emperor appears in the Offspring Palace you are “born to be a parent” You have strong predestined affinity with a child (son[s]).
    * You will have precocious and powerful children. They will be able to support you in old age.
    * You cannot be a “controlling parent”; you needn’t be a “protecting parent”. Your child (son) will be full of confidence and initiative.
    * A child (or your children) will be significant partners in your life.
    * Your children inspire you t create a legacy (spiritual/material).

    When the Emperor appears in the Offspring Palace with Empress (Tian Fu) or Tutor (Tian Xiang) your children will surpass you in social status, education, occupation and finance. One of your children will marry into a famous/wealthy family. One of your children will become a celebrity, hero or politician (enter government). Your child(ren) will be self-starters – have strong personal Fate; and therefore not need much “parenting”. Your child(ren) will parent you in your old age.
    You will make very much of your sexual or gender identity.

    When the Emperor appears in the Offspring Palace with 7 Killings (Qi Sha), Wolf (Tan Lang) or Rebel (Po Jun) your childrens’ or your own sexual identity will be unconventional. You will have few children. You will experience a miscarriage, infant death or abortion but recover well. You will recover from infertility or impotence to become the parent of a healthy child. You will adopt (rescue) a child who has the capacity to resolve much or all your Fate. You will live in a country that legalizes same-sex marriage. Your children may live very “different” lives or live far from you but this does not mean weak Fate resolution. One unmarried child will stay by your side for life. Being a parent will be a struggle but turn out well.

    Your children will be obedient, clever and good at their work. They will support you in old age. One or all your children will be very successful at school. One or all your children will have a “spiritual” disposition. Having two lesbian moms works well for you and your children.

    You will make repeated sacrifices for your children but they will not appreciate it and/or are unable to make use of it. Your children will be hard to control and there will be much discord. One or all your children will abandon you (or one die young). Juvenile Hall and Rehab will co-parent your children. Having two lesbian moms does NOT work well for you or your children. (The outcome of these “afflictions” can only be found in the child’s chart and character.)

    * Your children  will rebel at an early age and be less than perfect. Their independence and miscommunications will be difficult for you. 
    * You will parent children for several partners. Some may abandon you but others (Goat Blade) will take care of you later in life. 
    * Much of this difficulty will be the result of having children late in life. This subsides when the children mature. 
    * You may finally get randy in old age.

    You have solid Fate connections with a daughter (or shy son).  The home you share will be part of the relationship.  You are sexually conventional and find monogamy easy.

    * You are predestined to have a loving and capable daughter (or shy son). 
    * You will have some trouble with sons. They will reject your authority. 
    * Your children will be successful in business and dutifully support you in old age. 
    * You will leave a legacy (heritage and property) to your children. 
    * If there are no afflicting stars, even if you have only a daughter your family line does not end.

    You are haunted by the circumstances of parenting. You have an irrational fear of being a parent.

    * When the Seven Killings appears in the Offspring Palace or House of Children you are predestined to have one or two disagreeable children. You will not enjoy being a parent. 
    * You will have much trouble with a son who refuses to accept your authority. 
    * You will lose children to miscarriage, abortion or incomplete pregnancies. 
    * If there are other afflicting stars, you will have irresolvable differences with your children. They will abandon you or you them. 
    * You will be injured or murdered by one of your children. 
    * You will struggle with infertility. All the above are due to the promptings and obstructions of the unsettled dead.

    * The experience of being a parent will feel awkward and uncomfortable. 
    * You may raise other people’s children (partner’s children, adopted, foster care, etc.) and feel inept. 
    * Your children (especially boys) will turn on you, challenge you and abandon you. 
    * You or your partner will have a difficult incomplete pregnancy – there will be medical complications (or infertility/impotence). 
    
    These problems will clear by midlife (38).

    * You are at risk as a parent. 
    * Being a parent will be extremely challenging and may provoke medical and psychological problems. 
    * You or a child may die in childbirth. 
    * Your child is born with chronic medical condition and requires constant medical care – this exhausts your qi and resources. 
    * If you live together (w sons) you will exchange violence and/or threats. 
    * Your son will run away early. 
    * You will need to give your child(ren) up for adoption. 
    
    This affliction will last a lifetime.

    Your experience as a parent will be rife with difficulties. Irreconcilable differences will separate you from your children (sons).

    * When Rebel appears in the Offspring Palace you will have a disagreeable child (possessed of Pojun ghost, one who died as an orphan, unprotected and resentful). You will be an absent or part- time parent. 
    * You will have much irreconcilable trouble with a son who refuses to accept your authority. 
    * You will be a stepparent. 
    * If there are other afflicting stars, your children will not know you (divorce, abortion, and/or miscarriage). Your rebellious (possessed) child may experience premature death and/or madness (shen disturbance). If you fail to resolve Pojun before you die you (or both) will “join” the ghost as a ghost(s) in the transitory states

    * Though you have differences with your children they will live apart from you and prosper. 
    * They will do well in private school (military or religious). 
    * They will grow and develop independently. 
    * This separation will resolve the harsh Fate.

    You will lose your children to circumstances that work well for them. They will prosper despite your absence. They return to support you in old age.

    * Your children fight and argue with you. They will leave home and develop very adversarial lifestyles. 
    * You will have a handicapped child. 
    * You will be hurt and confused by them. 
    
    Despite this affliction they “return” to you and much Fate resolution occurs.
