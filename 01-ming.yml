    The predestined choreography of your fate is strong. You will feel driven, inspired and confident. The feeling of unfinished karmic business and finding karmic companions will powerfully motivate you. Your fate is shaped by things you are fated to do – yang qi characterizes your fate1. Your fate is shaped and motivated by your patriarchal ancestors. You are destined to succeed in fulfilling all the requirements of Fate – experience true Freedom with a sense of accomplishment and certainty.

    * When the Emperor appears alone in the Ming Palace or House of Fate the choreography of your fate is strong. You will feel predestined, inspired and confident. The feeling of unfinished karmic business and finding close, but lost, companions will powerfully motivate you.
    * Though passionate, you are likely to develop an elegant demeanor and deportment – act in a dignified manner and “rise to power” (be a “late bloomer”).
    * In your work you will be a manager and/or become an important contributor to your field of work. Prosperity will be easily found – even fame.
    * You are purposeful.
    * You are a leader.

    You are fated to be psychic, sensitive, intelligent and high strung. You may see the “other” world more clearly than the ordinary world. Your ancestral energy (abstract influences) and karma is very strong.

    The predestined choreography of your fate is strong but yin. You will feel blessed, protected, lucky and confident because of the actions of others. Your karmic knots will naturally unravel. Your fate in this lifetime is more “resultant” than “productive”. Learning to r e c e i v e and subordinate is essential to your fate resolution– yin qi characterizes your fate. Your fate is shaped and motivated by your matriarchal ancestors. If there are no afflictions, you are destined to celebrate success in all the requirements of Fate – experience true Freedom with a sense of accomplishment and dignity.

    Alone:

    * Your fate is subtle and complex. The complexity unravels slowly and completely without effort.
    * Though powerful, you are likely to succeed due to an elegant demeanor and deportment rather than aggression.
    * In your work you will be a manager and/or become an important supporter of others. Prosperity will be easily found – gifted rather than won.
    * You are seductive.
    * You are a coaxer.

    You waste your good karma with petty vanities and moodiness.

    * You are supported despite your moods.
    * Your uneven moods rid you of hypocritical support.
    * Persisting in your vanity brings about losses that leave you with negative karma at the end of your life.
    * You lack thoroughness and this leads to complications. You end up alone.

    *Alone in Ming Palace:*

    * Your fate is obscure and, like the Empress you are dependent. The obscure nature of your fate unravels itself slowly and completely without promptings.
    * Though powerful in some respects, you are likely to succeed due to an elegant appearance - never aggression.
    * In your work you will be an assistant and/or become an important supporter of others. Prosperity will be lunar (uneven) and usually gifted rather than earned by labor.
    * You are seductive.
    * You are a succubus.

    Your fate is mismatched to circumstances or place/time of your birth. You are aggressive and determined in resolving Fate.

    Generosity is the key to successfully resolving your Fate.  Your fate is shaped and motivated by your unsettled but helpful ancestors.

    If there are no afflictions, you are destined to meet all the requirements of Fate – experience Freedom with a very personal style.

    *Alone*

    * Your fate is hidden in the fine print and details. You have big good and bad karma. Independent thinking and action are your rule of thumb.
    * You are confident and aggressive.
    * Your self-created methods succeed.
    * Others inspire you but they do not support you.
    * You are not shy to show your strength.
    * You are an easy target – an underdog. You are a hero for underdogs.

    * Your peculiar style and hopeless ineptitude attract effective and thorough friends and assistants. 2) You succeed despite yourself. 3) You take up a spiritual Path or career that completely suits you. Success is effortless (only occasionally setback by your bungling). 4) Your unselfconscious squandering does not deplete your resources. Someone else manages your resources for you. 5) You will get the credit/benefit for other people’s work.
